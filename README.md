# 👋 Hi, I'm Tobby

### Senior .NET Developer | Cloud & API Engineer | SDET/Automation | Security-Focused

I’m a software engineer with 10+ years of experience delivering enterprise systems across government, 
finance, and healthcare. I build modern .NET APIs, cloud-ready architectures, integration workflows, and 
scalable automation frameworks. I also focus on documentation, modernization, and improving the 
reliability of complex legacy environments.

Right now I’m expanding into **cybersecurity** (Google Cybersecurity Professional), blending development, 
automation, and investigative analysis.
